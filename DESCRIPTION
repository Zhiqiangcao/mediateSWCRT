Description: Functions for calculating the point and interval estimates of the natural indirect effect (NIE), natural direct effect (NDE), total effect (TE), and mediation proportion (MP) in a stepped wedge cluster randomized trials with a constant treatment effect or an exposure-time dependent treatment effect. We perform the methods considered in Cao and Li (2024) Assessing mediation in cross-sectional stepped wedge cluster randomized trials.
