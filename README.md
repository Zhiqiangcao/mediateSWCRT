Mediation Analysis in a Stepped Wedge Cluster Randomized Trials

Functions for calculating the point and interval estimates of the natural indirect effect (NIE), natural direct effect (NDE), total effect (TE), and mediation proportion (MP) in a stepped wedge cluster randomized trials with a constant treatment effect or time-dependent treatment effect. We perform the methods considered in Cao and Li (2024) Assessing mediation in cross-sectional stepped wedge cluster randomized trials.

The manual of mediateSWCRT package and the Web Appendices for the manuscript ``Cao, Z. and Li, F. (2024). Assessing mediation in cross-sectional stepped wedge cluster randomized trials. arXiv preprint arXiv:2410.15596." are also provided.
